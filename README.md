# COVID19-IMAGE-CLASSIFICATION
Description The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread globally and caused unprecedented damages worldwide. Technology, in particular AI, can play an important role in helping fight against this pandemic. In addition, lessons learned can be helpful in fighting and preventing future pandemics. Multiple hospitals and health professionals have shared COVID-19 images coming from multiple modalities to help advance the research in the field.  This challenge aims to develop a multiclass classification algorithm capable of detecting COVID-19 in Chest X-ray images. The dataset contains 3 image classes: COVID-19, Pneumonia and Normal (healthy) (See example images below). With 20,000+ images, the participants can train their algorithms to solve this challenge. A test set will be released and will be used to benchmark the obtained results.
